# Trivia-Game
A trivia game where multiple choice questions appear on the screen and the user has a time limit to answer all the questions.
For this trivia game we went with a soccer theme. The questions are based on leagues and players from around the world. Upon
clicking the start button the user will be given a time limit to answer our three soccer trivia questions. The timer was 
created using the timing methods built it in to javascript. We used jquery to create the "on click" event listeners. The answers
are checked for correct or incorrect values and sent to corresponding arrays. Upon click of the "finsh" button or the end of the
alotted time we used alerts to tell the user which answers were correct and which were incorrect.
